# SilvaniaMod
The Silvania is a world of programmatic magic and mystic factions.

<h1>Spells</h1>
Spells are a system of magic which rely on block placement. To cast a spell, you need the Runic Workbench and the Spiritual Wand. 


<h1>OBSOLETE????</h1>
WOOD NYMPHS:

<ul>
  <li> Wood Nymphs are simple villager-like mobs; however, they can fly and have magical abilities.
    <li>Wood nymphs path navigate in more or less the same way as ghasts (?)
   <li> Because wood nymphs do not need stairs, players would need other ways to ascend the walls of their silvaniae. Vines might help
     <li>Wood nymphs sleep on bed-branches by hanging upside down from them. 
       <li>Wood nymphs can open doors; however they do not use them and their houses only have permeable curtains in front. 
       <li>Wood nymphs shed wingscales which develop permeable layers on the floor (like snow, but passable except that it slows down travel and has a tiny chance of applying the 'sick' effect)
      <li>Wood nymphs eat plant based items, primarily Sap and apples
        <li>Wood nymphs do proper jobs. They earn money and use it to buy what they need from each other.
          <ul>
            <li>Crop Farmer: A wood nymph farmer actually harvests crops from farmland, plants, and re-tills farmland and restocks water
              <li>Sap Farmer: A sap farmer moves along wood blocks and collects their sap; wood blocks have a sap cooldown time
              <li>Janitor: A janitor goes to places with wingscale layers and sweeps them up, 1 layer per second
                <li>Guard: A guard hides in the leaves (turns invisible when standing on leaves) and attacks enemies when they come near the tree, or attacks those with a negative reputation toward the nymphs
     <li>Medic: Heals nymphs who get hurt in any way
       <li>Toolmaker: Appears to do nothing; in actuality is producing tools for other nymphs
         <li>Gatherer: Flies around tree and collects stone, wood, and produces metal from thin air--I mean, mines metal
          </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Wood nymphs
  </ul>
  
  SICK:
  
  Sickness is a simple wood nymph mechanic where dirty conditions can cause wood nymphs to develop an effect that deals a tiny amount of damage which increases in frequency the longer the effect is active. It also has a chance of being passed onto other creatures by proximity.
  
ITEMS:
  
* Sap: Sap is a food harvestable by wood nymphs from tree blocks
